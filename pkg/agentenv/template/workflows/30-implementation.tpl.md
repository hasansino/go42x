### Implementation

Systematic approach for writing production-ready code.

#### Phase 1: Planning

- Understand the requirements completely
- Analyze existing code patterns and structure
- Identify dependencies and interfaces
- Plan your approach and implementation steps

#### Phase 2: Setup

- Create necessary branches
- Set up development environment
- Install required dependencies
- Create file structure

#### Phase 3: Implementation

- **Write code incrementally**: Start with core logic
- **Follow identified patterns**: Match existing style
- **Add tests alongside implementation**: TDD when possible
- **Document as you go**: Comments and documentation

#### Phase 4: Testing

- Unit tests for individual functions
- Integration tests for components
- Edge cases and error scenarios
- Performance validation

#### Phase 5: Verification

- **Code quality**: Linting and formatting
- **Functionality**: All requirements met
- **Tests passing**: Full test suite green
- **Documentation**: Updated and complete

#### Phase 6: Review & Improve

- Self-review for obvious issues
- Refactor for clarity and efficiency
- Report task completion status
- Highlight any issues encountered

#### Best Practices

- Commit frequently with clear messages
- Keep functions small and focused
- Handle errors appropriately
- Consider future maintainability
