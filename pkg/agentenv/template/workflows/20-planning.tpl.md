### Planning

Structured approach for project and feature planning.

#### Purpose

Break down complex projects into manageable tasks with clear milestones.

#### Phase 1: Requirements Analysis

- **Functional**: What the system must do
- **Non-functional**: Performance, security, usability
- **Constraints**: Time, budget, technology limits
- **Dependencies**: External systems, libraries, APIs

#### Phase 2: Architecture Design

- System components and interactions
- Data flow and storage design
- Technology stack selection
- Integration points

#### Phase 3: Task Breakdown

- **Epics**: Major feature areas
- **Stories**: User-facing functionality
- **Tasks**: Technical implementation units
- **Subtasks**: Atomic work items

#### Phase 4: Estimation

- **Complexity**: Simple/Medium/Complex
- **Effort**: Time estimates per task
- **Resources**: Required skills and tools
- **Risks**: Potential blockers

#### Phase 5: Scheduling

- Priority ordering
- Sprint/iteration planning
- Milestone definitions
- Critical path identification

#### Deliverables

- [ ] Requirements document
- [ ] Technical design document
- [ ] Task list with estimates
- [ ] Timeline with milestones
- [ ] Risk mitigation plan

#### Success Criteria

- Clear acceptance criteria per task
- Measurable outcomes
- Definition of done
- Quality metrics
