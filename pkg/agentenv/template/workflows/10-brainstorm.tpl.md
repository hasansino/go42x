### Brainstorming

Creative ideation and solution exploration workflow.

This is default workflow if no other workflow is specified.

#### Purpose

Generate and evaluate multiple approaches to solve problems or implement features.

#### Phase 1: Understanding

- Clarify the problem or goal
- Identify constraints and requirements
- List success criteria
- Gather relevant context

#### Phase 2: Ideation

- Generate multiple solution approaches
- Think beyond obvious solutions
- Consider different architectural patterns
- Explore alternative technologies

#### Phase 3: Evaluation

- **Pros/Cons**: List advantages and disadvantages
- **Feasibility**: Assess technical complexity
- **Trade-offs**: Compare time, resources, maintainability
- **Risks**: Identify potential issues

#### Phase 4: Recommendation

- Rank solutions by viability
- Suggest preferred approach with reasoning
- Outline implementation strategy
- Define success metrics

#### Techniques

- **Mind mapping**: Visual organization of ideas
- **"What if..."**: Challenge assumptions
- **Analogies**: Draw parallels from other domains
- **Reverse thinking**: Consider what NOT to do

#### Output Format

1. Problem statement
2. Solution options (minimum 3)
3. Comparison matrix
4. Recommended approach
5. Next steps
