### Development

#### Process

- **Incremental**: Build features step by step
- **Testing**: Write unit tests for new code, aim to cover critical paths and edge cases
- **Reviews**: Self-review before finishing a task
- **Documentation**: Comment only complex, difficult-to-read logic, restrain from commenting elsewhere
- **Commiting**: NEVER commit or stage any files, ALL staging and commiting is done exclusively by the user
