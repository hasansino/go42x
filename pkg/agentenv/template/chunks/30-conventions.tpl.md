# Project Conventions

## Overview

**IMPORTANT:** These conventions are mandatory unless explicitly overridden.

### Core Rules

1. **[IGNORE] blocks** - Skip any content between `[IGNORE]` and `[/IGNORE]` tags
2. **Reference existing code** - Always examine similar files before creating new ones
3. **Follow /CONVENTIONS.md** - This file contains project-specific standards that must be followed

### When Deviating from Conventions

If you need to violate a convention:

1. **STOP** and explain why the deviation is necessary
2. **ASK** for explicit approval before proceeding
3. **DOCUMENT** the approved change in `/CONVENTIONS.md` after implementation

### Priority Order

1. Project-specific conventions in `/CONVENTIONS.md`
2. Language idioms and best practices
3. Team preferences (when explicitly stated)
4. General clean code principles
